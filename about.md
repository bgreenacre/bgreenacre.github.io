I'm a web developer, sysadmin, devops, dba and business owner. I'm currently working at [Sears Holdings](http://www.searsholdings.com/) as a devops under contract. I enjoy building web applications using Open Source Software like php, nginx, linux (Debian) and MySQL. Also, scaling these different services to support high volume traffic is something I really enjoy doing.

I consider myself a regular book reader, music enthusiast, dog owner and tinkerer.
